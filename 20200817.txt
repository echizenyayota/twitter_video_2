But what brought them together was the civil rights movement of 1960s. And that’s how they met as students in the streets of Oakland, marching and shouting for this thing called “Justice”, in a struggle that continues today. And I was a part of it. My parents would bring me to protests, strapped tightly in my stroller.

And it’s the people who I fought for as a United Staes Senetor, where I’ve worked every day to hold Trump officials accountable to the American people. And the people are who Joe and I will fight for every day in White House.
